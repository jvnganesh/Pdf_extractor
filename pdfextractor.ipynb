            " ¾It is necessary to have a National Security Strategy(NSS), National Defense Strategy(NDS) and Higher Defense Organization before creating a theatre command, only then it would be logical to think of a theatre command. The four key aspects of the army’s restructuring are human resource management, modernization and incorporation of technology, rebalancing and restructuring, and jointness and better integration.\n",
            " ¾Along with the NSS, there is also a need for a Higher Defence Organization that gives effect to the entire country’s vision and has representation from all concerned ministries. A top-level Defence Planning Committee headed by the National Security Advisor was set up in 2018 to prepare the NSS and NDS but no progress has been made so far. For the modernization of the Indian Army, it is necessary to make its institutional, organizational structure more logical and result-oriented and move towards creating a theatre command while managing all the necessary resources. More than 32 countries around the world already have theatre or joint command in some form or the other to bring about better integration among their military forces. Notably, the United States was the first country to implement the Theatre Command System, which currently consists of six geographic and four functional commands. Russia also started with the restructuring of its defence forces in 2008 and has four theatre commands. China’s theatre command system is said to be based on the American model and has “five geographical commands in times of peace”. The Chinese Western Theatre Command covers the area adjacent to the Indian border.\n",
            " ¾The idea behind the ‘Theatre Command System’ is to bring synergistic coordination among the three branches of the armed forces. In addition, it aims to bring separate commands for the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a unified command led by a single commander. The integration process will eventually lead to integrated military assets connected in a single command under an operational head, who will be responsible for directing and controlling their activities in a given situation.\n",
            " ¾In conclusion, it can be said that the Indian Army, famous for its military capability all over the world, is paying special attention to modernization along with changes in its functioning. The new defence system is being developed in collaboration with various organizations in the country associated with the defence industry to upgrade the weapons. In this sequence, the Army is also working rapidly on the vision of defense self-reliance, as a result of which not only indigenous technologies are being adopted in the army but defense exports have also seen a boom. Along with the theaterization of the army, the Army is also committed to the development of a National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Higher Defense Organization. The Central Government is fully committed to further strengthening the security forces by working fast on military changes in the coming year.\n",
